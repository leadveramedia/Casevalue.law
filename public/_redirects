# Netlify Redirects for Prerendered SPA
# react-snap generates static HTML files for each route during build
# Netlify serves these static files first, then falls back to SPA for dynamic routes
#
# How this works:
# 1. Netlify checks if a static file exists (e.g., /blog/index.html)
# 2. If yes, serve the static prerendered file (SEO-friendly!)
# 3. If no, serve /index.html and let React Router handle it (status 200 = rewrite, not redirect)
#
# This gives us the best of both worlds:
# - Static HTML for crawlers (Google, social media bots) = better SEO
# - Client-side routing for users = smooth SPA experience

# SPA fallback - serve index.html for all requests that don't match a static file
# Status 200 means "rewrite" not "redirect" - important for SEO!
